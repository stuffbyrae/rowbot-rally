# RowBot Rally
My most ambitious game to date, made for Playdate over the course of a hell of a long time. I can't guarantee any good practice code in here, but feel free to poke around and swipe anything you'd find useful!

A full list of credits and dependencies can be found [here](https://rae.wtf/blog/rowbot-rally-manual#credits).

If you wanna play this game, it's available for purchase [here](https://play.date/games/rowbot-rally). Or, if you just LOVE command line tools and HATE paying money for things, use `pdc` to build the `source/` folder, and enjoy! (Note that scoreboard functions won't work properly when building from source â€” for proper leaderboard support, please consider buying the game in Catalog!)

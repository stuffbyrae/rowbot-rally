-- This file is where all the routes the CPU players take are held.
-- These are pre-recorded in development. See race.lua for instructions on how to record a new CPU route.

-- Each stage where a CPU is present should have at least three or four different CPU routes, which are chosen from at random during runtime.
-- The numbers are sorted like this:
-- X coordinate
-- Y coordinate
-- Boat rotation
-- Wake turning number
-- Wake X coordinate
-- Wake Y coordinate
